# Hello, everyone who got to this profile

## I welcome you.

I'm learning programming in HL languages, digital circuit design, assembly coding.
I know how to make a little bit of stuff even though most of my projects don't appear
on GitHub because they are private and stupid enough for people to not see them. I am
interested in doing embedded systems programming.
